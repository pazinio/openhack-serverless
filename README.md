<b>Serverless OpenHack<b/>

<br>
Serverless computing allows for scalable and reliable event based processing for code and workflows. It accelerates the development of applications while hiding the infrastructure and providing auto-scale and micro-billing. Serverless technologies like Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Event Grid are some of the services being adopted by development teams in startups, ISVs, and enterprises to implement new or extend existing solutions. Companies that adopt serverless benefit from a fast time to market and only pay for what they use.

<br>
These services work in combination with other Azure services and form the core of this OpenHack and underpin everything you'll be exploring as you progress through the challenges.
